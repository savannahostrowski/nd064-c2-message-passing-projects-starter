The message passing strategies that would integrate well when refactoring into a microservice architecture are REST, gRPC, and Kafka. Iâ€™ve selected these strategies because:
- REST is the industry standard meaning that there should be sufficient resources and developers at the company should be well-versed in this technology
- gRPC is really fast (faster than REST) and will be ideal having the services of our application communicate
- Kafka is ideal for handling the ingress of a large volume of data. It will help ensure that our application is performant and reliable by acting as a broker for location data.
